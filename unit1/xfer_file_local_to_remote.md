# How to Transfer Files from Local to Remote (or Vice Versa)
1. Open your terminal.
2. Identify the path of your local file.
3. Use `scp` to transfer your local file to a remote server: `scp <local_file_path> <destination_server>`
    1. Note: you may have to enter a password if your local and/or remote servers have restricted      access
    2. For example: ![xfer_local_to_remote_screenshot](https://github.com/kaylahudson/biol3411/assets/80914229/c3a66c75-6432-4902-a52b-466e591730c1)
4. Navigate to the remote server and verify that the file has been transferred!
